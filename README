TRIBBE-OVERLAY(8)                                              TRIBBE-OVERLAY(8)



NAME
       tribbe-overlay - overlay for Gentoo Linux used by Tom Ribbens

DESCRIPTION
       This  overlay is used for personal hacking of Gentoo Linux: addition of
       unofficial/unsupported ebuilds, masking/unmasking according to personal
       preferences and so on.

INSTALLATION
       Installation  is  rather  simple: all you have to do is to register new
       overlay in your system. Additonally, you may want to  add  symlinks  to
       Documentation/package.{keywords,mask,unmask}/*.

   Installation via layman
       You will need app-portage/layman installed:
       emerge -avq app-portage/layman

       tribbe-overlay  isn't  in  the  official  overlays list - just add over-
       lays.xml from the root of tribbe-overlay:
       layman   -o    https://github.com/tomribbens/tribbe-overlay/raw/master/over-
       lays.xml -a tribbe-overlay
       Layman   may   ignore  '--overlay'  option.  Workaround:  you  can  add
       https://github.com/tomribbens/tribbe-overlay/raw/master/overlays.xml      to
       'overlays'  section  in  /etc/layman/layman.cfg and refetch overlays to
       put them to layman's cache.

       Don't  forget  to  add  'source   /var/lib/layman/make.conf'   to   the
       /etc/make.conf

   Manual installation
       Go to wherever you want to place overlays:
       mkdir -p /var/lib/my_overlays
       cd /var/lib/my_overlays

       Clone git repository.
       git clone https://github.com/tomribbens/tribbe-overlay.git

       Register overlay in PORTDIR_OVERLAY in the /etc/make.conf.
       PORTDIR_OVERLAY="$PORTDIR_OVERLAY /var/lib/my_overlays/tribbe-overlay"




                                                              TRIBBE-OVERLAY(8)
